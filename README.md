## There are 3 ways of using & playing Breachers:
1. [PCVR](https://github.com/RihardsGold/Breachers-Auto-Installer-Updater/wiki/PCVR)
2. Standalone | [Installing from PC](https://github.com/RihardsGold/Breachers-Auto-Installer-Updater/wiki/Standalone---Full-guide-PC) / [Installing from Android](https://github.com/RihardsGold/Breachers-Auto-Installer-Updater/wiki/Installing-from-Android)
3. [Spectator tool](https://github.com/RihardsGold/Breachers-Auto-Installer-Updater/wiki/Spectator-tool)

## Common problems & troubleshoots
### I want to install with an iPhone.
Thanks to Apple restrictions on iOS, you can't use ADB on iPhones. In our case, iPhones are not viable.
### Updating the game
Quest: 
1. Uninstall the game from your headset.
2. Re-install the same way as you did [the first time](https://github.com/RihardsGold/Breachers-Auto-Installer-Updater/wiki/Installing-from-Android).

PCVR & Spectator tool:  
1. Delete the game files from your headset.
2. [Re-download](https://github.com/RihardsGold/Breachers-Auto-Installer-Updater/wiki/PCVR#installation--playing) the game.
